# Angular Arcade

This project was made by Peter Brink and Sam Lamsma

Made for CS336 at Calvin University Fall 2024

Originally this was meant to be a site where you could play pinball on but it became too much of a commitment and too many errors occured.
So we then changed into an arcade style website. We planned to implement more games but having to restart on such a short time we were unable to.
With both of us being busy with other finals this is what we ended up with. Both of us really enjoyed the process and the end result.


In order to get this to run just clone the repository, cd into the PinballPlayground repository,
run a quick npm install to make sure all packages are there, and then ng serve -o

The implementation of putting a new high score in does work, you just have to beat one of the top 10 scores :D
